This repository is the collection of my solutions as I go through the CS50x course.

CS50 is a introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently.

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/honesty/). While these solutions can help you to get through the course, you should do your best to figure out a viable answer before taking a look at any of these. Investing time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is, in my opinion, the best way to true learning.
